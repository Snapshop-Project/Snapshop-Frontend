# Just Browsing /Snapshop-Frontend/
when you first open up the website, you will be at /Snapshop-Frontend/ this is the main page where you can browse and search for photos. If you hover over any photos it will show some details about the images. If you press the search bar you can search for anyhting and if it matches the name in anyway it will come up. Can press x in the search bar to delete what you search and go back to show everything. If you press the filter Icon to the right of the search bar it opens filter options. As you click filters it will be appiled immediately, if you press it again it will be removed or just press clear filter.

# logging in /Snapshop-Frontend/login & /Snapshop-Frontend/createAccount & /Snapshop-Frontend/forgotPassword
If you arent logged in the top right will have a login button that takes you to login, this is required to checkout on our website and to access your profile and track sales. After you press you have a logging page, if you know your data you put it in, if its correct you will be logged in, if not it will say invalid credentials. You can press forgot password which will ask for an email to send reset password link to, it wont actually send but this is how it would work. If you dont have an account you will press create account and you will enter your information. If any fields empty, or email is invalid format or the password doesnt meet the requirments(these will be displayed if you try to signup without meeting requirments, try to make account to see). Your account wont actually work obviosuly because lack of backend so to login and exprience the logged in features use the email and password mentioned above. Now you will see the profile pick in the top right

# Cart/Checkout /Snapshop-Frontend/cart & /Snapshop-Frontend/checkout
If you press the cart there are items in already to display how it would work, if you remove all items using the x in the top right of each item, you will see that you cannot go to checkout and its greyed out. If you refresh the page you will get the items back, the numbers in Cart summary update to show how much items and how much total money the cart is. If you press Checkout and arent logged it will ask you to login to continue. After you log in it will take you directly to checkout page if you went from that popup. Checkout page there is payment info, we set it up so it doesnt have any data in it so you see what it looks like and how you can checkout with it. Also we only show the last for digits of your payment and nothing else for safety, if you press change all your data is right there for you to make micro or macro changes. You can add it and see how the fields are all required and require the correct input, in terms of length of digits and type of input(numbers when it should be numbers). After you do this you can change it if you want or press purchase. It will say your purchase will be emailed to you and let you go back to home page.

# Viewing pictures /Snapshop-Frontend/
if you want to view more information on an image or add it to your card, if you press on it you get a zoomed in version with way more description, I cant give you the path due to it being different for every image.
