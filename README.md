# Running this project
run "npm install"
run "npm start"

# Components
Try to make as many things as a component to make it easier to reuse and makes our code cleaner
When making new component make it in this fashion: src/components/component-name/ComponentName

# Pages
When making new pages make it in this fashion: src/pages/page-name/index.jsx
Then the styling for each page: src/pages/page-name/styles.css

# Assets
when adding any images or assets of any sort add in this fashion: public/assets/asset-name

# Branches
Make sure to be working on your own branch since if something goes wrong, we still have a previous version of main to revert to, we will merge changes into main after it all looks good
